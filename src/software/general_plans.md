# Software, General Plans and Procedures
*By Matt and Arjun*


## What is our plan for the next few weeks?
**Software Leadership has created what we call a “rolling plan”**

We have planned the next few weeks based on a limited viewpoint. Obviously, over the course of the season things will happen so drastically and quickly that we cannot account for all the changes. 


- In order to account for this, when Leadership meets to plan the future of software, we will plan the subdivision and their respective tasks only as far as two weeks in advance. This makes sure that long-chain production strategies are not disrupted
- Software Leadership will suggest roles
- Based on the interest survey we have set out, interest surveys we will continue to send out, and the computational/work demands of the respective subteam, we will balance you among the subdivision that are emerging
- Sometimes you will not be suggested to the subdivision you expressed interest in on the survey. This is because we do not want to have 11 students on RGB Team and 1 student on Drive (sub)Team when Drive is much much more important to the competition


These are optional. If you really want to be on a subteam with a friend just ask us and we will switch you

**What does this mean for you?**

- Under the “What is our plan for the next few weeks” block of this document, you will be able to see the current “rolling plan” and the sub teams that are active during the current/next/next next week.


- If a subteam is not present the week/day after a week/day that it exists for, that subteam is dissolved, because whatever it was trying to achieve has been completed or obsoleted by season strategies.


- Please check this doc for general plan updates, they will appear in here and in software-info



**With that out of the way, here is our plan as of 1/6/24**

- 1/6 ONLY

  - UX Subdivision - Responsible for coming up with the button inputs and coding them into existence

- 1/7 - 1/14

  - Drive Subdivision - Responsible for learning how the current drive/odometry code works

  - Shooter Subdivision - Responsible for writing preliminary code to control AND SIMULATE the shooter

  - ‘Eyes’ Subdivision - Responsible for learning how the current vision code and vision infrastructure works, input all field/vision constants into code, responsible for setting up PhotonVision onto the new OrangePis once they arrive

- 1/14 - 1/21

  - Odometry/Drive Subdivision - Responsible for coding drive autonomous routes based on game strategy (TBD)

  - Shooter Subdivision - Continue Work

  - Eyes Team - Set up multiple camera vision, vision filtering (intro to kalman filter)

## What should you do first at meetings?

In order,



**Collect information from Software Leadership**

- We will give announcements on current tasks, the progress of your and other subdivisions, and as the situation requires subdivision specific lessons.

- We may sometimes give surveys to check up on subdivision progress

**Collect information from Mechanical**

- We will try to set aside a specific period at the beginning of each meeting to have each software subdivision communicate with mechanical subdivisions

**Check [Software Projects](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZVR3NF4eum5lGa81ugy1T1uEbDaprLVyZKNRlMniG7s/edit#gid=0) for updates to your specific tasks**

- Arjun will update the software projects sheet to specify what specific tasks each subdivision may have
- If you know of a conceptual “task” that the subdivision is working on that is not listed on the projects sheet, please let Matt or Arjun know so we can update it

**Nothing to work on?**

- If you do not have an active project and nothing was assigned to you, please talk to Matt or Arjun to see what you can do

- We encourage you to create new tasks to advance the project even if nothing has been assigned to you yet

## What does a typical Season Meeting look like?

- Do the above: What should you do first at meetings?

- Communicate with your subdivision on what needs to be done to achieve the current subdivision tasks

 - Work on subdivision tasks

- Cook code that will take us to worlds!!


## What will be the general schedule for the code?

Good question! The schedule for the code will change drastically after a specific point in time, being the switch from ‘master-branch’ 

**The first two weeks will be free-form**
 
- This means that code will not be reviewed, and there will be no branches. 
As soon as you finish your code, you will push it immediately to the main branch and no one will check it

**After the first two weeks, code will be reviewed**

- For new subdivision features, you will make a new branch and keep it up to date with all changes from main branch

- As soon as you think the branch is done, you will push it to github (where it will remain on it’s separate branch) AND THEN create a PULL REQUEST. Software leadership will conduct a review of your code and once it is approved it will be merged into the main branch

- When new code is merged into the main branch, Software Leadership will announce it first thing in the meeting, and make sure everyone is up to date with it

- If you have nothing to do, you can contribute to the branch reviews, as they show up publicly on github.


## How do I get started coding?
 
*You gave me a task and I don’t know how to make the jump between task to code yet. What are some steps I can take?*

Let’s refer back to [S01](https://gamma.app/docs/S01-Effective-Strategies-in-Software-for-Learning-and-Coding-lrmzbk3fni46l0d), with the Blackbox approach and the Bitbuckets Thinking approach


- Logic-Based Workflow

  - What is your goal? What does your code do? (Outputs)

    - the main problem that code is solving

  - What information do you have? (Inputs)

    - relevant factors, data

  - What restrictions do you have?

    - make sure to keep your code within the scope of the problem

- Translate Your Goals

  - Determine what your code should do to achieve the goal

  - How can our inputs give us our outputs?

    - Determine the scope of your code

- Black Box

  *Shoot! Im trying to iteratively design and I have stumbled across a concept that I do not know. What should I do?*

  - Keep calm and black box!

      - Think purely in terms of inputs and outputs ie “what goes into this thing” and “what comes out of this thing”

  - When not to blackbox

    - Concepts you understand

      - We black box to save time. It is not the optimal method for learning, so if you can understand something, don’t black box

    - Concepts that have appeared many times

      - If you have seen something a lot, it is likely important enough to get a deeper understanding, so read other docs and ask Matt, Arjun, or Craig about the concept


This is a basic summary to jog your memory, but please go look at S01 in its entirety if you are still confused.


## What less-stressful tasks can I do?

*I’m busy with school/sick/need to finish x or y or z and still want to contribute to the team, but I don’t know*

- Here are some general tasks you can work on:
