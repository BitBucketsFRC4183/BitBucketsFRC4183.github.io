# Software, General Plans and Procedures
*Matt and Arjun*


## What is our plan for the next few weeks?
Software Leadership has created what we call a “rolling plan”
We have planned the next few weeks based on a limited viewpoint. Obviously, over the course of the season things will happen so drastically and quickly that we cannot account for all the changes. 


- In order to account for this, when Leadership meets to plan the future of software, we will plan the subdivision and their respective tasks only as far as two weeks in advance. This makes sure that long-chain production strategies are not disrupted
- Software Leadership will suggest roles
- Based on the interest survey we have set out, interest surveys we will continue to send out, and the computational/work demands of the respective subteam, we will balance you among the subdivision that are emerging
- Sometimes you will not be suggested to the subdivision you expressed interest in on the survey. This is because we do not want to have 11 students on RGB Team and 1 student on Drive (sub)Team when Drive is much much more important to the competition


These are optional. If you really want to be on a subteam with a friend just ask us and we will switch you
What does this mean for you?
Under the “What is our plan for the next few weeks” block of this document, you will be able to see the current “rolling plan” and the sub teams that are active during the current/next/next next week.


If a subteam is not present the week/day after a week/day that it exists for, that subteam is dissolved, because whatever it was trying to achieve has been completed or obsoleted by season strategies.


Please check this doc for general plan updates, they will appear in here and in software-info


With that out of the way, here is our plan as of 1/6/24
1/6 ONLY
UX Subdivision - Responsible for coming up with the button inputs and coding them into existence
1/7 - 1/14
Drive Subdivision - Responsible for learning how the current drive/odometry code works
Mechanism Subdivision - Responsible for writing preliminary code to control AND SIMULATE the mechanism
‘Eyes’ Subdivision - Responsible for learning how the current vision code and vision infrastructure works, input all field/vision constants into code, responsible for setting up PhotonVision onto the new OrangePis once they arrive
1/14 - 1/21
Odometry/Drive Subdivision - Responsible for coding drive autonomous routes based on game strategy (TBD)
Mechanism Subdivision - Continue Work
Eyes Team - Set up multiple camera vision, vision filtering (intro to kalman filter)
What should you do first at meetings?
In order,


Collect information from Software Leadership
We will give announcements on current tasks, the progress of your and other subdivisions, and as the situation requires subdivision specific lessons.
We may sometimes give surveys to check up on subdivision progress
Collect information from Mechanical
We will try to set aside a specific period at the beginning of each meeting to have each software subdivision communicate with mechanical subdivisions
Check Software Projects for updates to your specific tasks
Arjun will update the software projects sheet to specify what specific tasks each subdivision may have
If you know of a conceptual “task” that the subdivision is working on that is not listed on the projects sheet, please let me or Arjun know so we can update it
Nothing to work on?
If you do not have an active project and nothing was assigned to you, please talk to Matt or Arjun to see what you can do
We encourage you to create new tasks to advance the project even if nothing has been assigned to you yet
What does a typical Season Meeting look like?
Do the above: What should you do first at meetings?
Communicate with your subdivision on what needs to be done to achieve the current subdivision tasks
Work on subdivision tasks
Cook code that will take us to worlds!!

What will be the general schedule for the code?
Good question! The schedule for the code will change drastically after a specific point in time, being the switch from ‘master-branch’ 
How do I get started coding? 
You gave me a task and I don’t know how to make the jump between task to code yet. What are some steps I can take?

Let’s refer back to S01, with the Blackbox approach and the Bitbuckets Thinking approach


Logic-Based Workflow
What is your goal? What does your code do? (Outputs)
the main problem that code is solving
What information do you have? (Inputs)
relevant factors, data
What restrictions do you have?
make sure to keep your code within the scope of the problem
Translate You Goals
Determine what your code should do to achieve the goal
How can our inputs give us our outputs?
Determine the scope of your code
Black Box
Shoot! Im trying to iteratively design and I have stumbled across a concept that I do not know. What should I do?
Keep calm and black box!
Think purely in terms of inputs and outputs ie “what goes into this thing” and “what comes out of this thing”
When not to blackbox
Concepts you understand
We black box to save time. It is not the optimal method for learning, so if you can understand something, don’t black box
Concepts that have appeared many times
If you have seen something a lot, it is likely important enough to get a deeper understanding, so read other docs and ask Matt, Arjun, or Craig about the concept

This is a basic summary to jog your memory, but please go look at S01 in its entirety if you are still confused.


What less-stressful tasks can I do?
I’m busy with school/sick/need to finish x or y or z and still want to contribute to the team, but I don’t know
