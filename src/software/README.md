# Software

**IMPORTANT: [What do all these fancy software words 
mean?](./software/terminology.md)**

> The BitBuckets Software division wiki

## What do we do?
The Software subdivision of BitBuckets handles all of the code that 
controls the robot, as opposed to the structure and design of the robot 

## What will we learn/need to know
Software revolves around writing subsystems, or compartmentalized blocks 
of code for each aspect that the robot needs to have. For instance, if the 
robot needs to move based on what it sees, we would have a Drive subsystem 
control the wheels and communicate with a Vision subsystem to tell it 
where to go.

You'll be working with Java a lot so it's important to have a grasp on
not just the basics but many specifics of the language like Object 
Oriented Design

We'll also be working with a First Robotics specific library called WPILib 
which helps us control the robot parts' built in code

## Tools we use
- Java (Code)
- Gradle (Dependency Manager)
- Git (Version Control)
- WPILib (Robot Library)

## Highlights
- Better than Mechanical
- Live in the Basement
- Write code and complain when it doesn't work
- Hackerman
