When you work on a coding project alone, it's easy to make lots of changes 
and still know where everything is and how it works. However, when working 
in a team it becomes harder to understand since everyone writes code their 
own way. One solution to this is standardization - coding standards that 
we should follow in order to make the code more understandable for 
everybody.
